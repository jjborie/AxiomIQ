# Functional Specification: EvalForge (AI Knowledge Evaluation Platform)

## 1. System Overview

EvalForge is a full-scale platform designed to automate the cross-evaluation of Generative AI models through multiple-choice question (MCQ) assessments across domain-specific knowledge areas. Initially conceived for the Department of Defense’s Cyber Workforce Framework (DCWF), EvalForge is extendable to domains like healthcare, finance, and education.

## 2. Objectives

- **Cross-Evaluate AI Models**: AI models assess each other’s proficiency using domain-specific MCQs.
- **Automate Scoring**: Evaluate model responses with no human grading.
- **Standardize Metrics**: Enable benchmarking and scoring consistency.
- **Insight Generation**: Identify knowledge gaps through analytics.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Evaluation Engine
- Peer-based and parallel evaluation modes
- Score computation (accuracy, category breakdown)
- Cross-evaluation matrix logging

### 3.2 Question Bank
- Import/export questions
- Tag questions with domain/KUs/difficulty
- Topic coverage assurance

### 3.3 Model Integration
- Unified interface for LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace)
- Async API query handling
- Error recovery and retry logic

### 3.4 Benchmarking
- Integrate with CyberSecEval 2, SECURE datasets
- Compare MCQ scores vs benchmark scores
- Generate statistical correlation insights

### 3.5 Results & Analytics
- Display and export scores, breakdowns
- Support ANOVA and correlation analysis
- Model vs model performance visualization

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Concurrency for multi-model queries
- **Scalability**: Containerized services (Docker/Kubernetes)
- **Security**: Auth, encrypted storage, NIST alignment
- **Extensibility**: Pluggable model adapter architecture
- **Compliance**: DoD-ready audit logging and traceability

## 5. Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Celery
- **Frontend**: React, Material-UI, React Query
- **Model Integration**: HuggingFace Transformers, OpenAI API, Async HTTPX
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions CI/CD

## 6. System Architecture

- Microservices: Orchestrator, Model Interface, Question Bank
- REST API with JWT Auth
- Asynchronous background workers for evaluations
- Database schema includes Models, Questions, Evaluations, Answers

## 7. UI Design

- Admin dashboard (models, evaluations, questions)
- Evaluation wizard (setup -> run -> results)
- Drill-down analytics for each question and knowledge area
- Export to CSV/PDF, chart visualizations

## 8. APIs

- `POST /evaluations`: Start evaluation
- `GET /evaluations/{id}`: Get results
- `POST /questions`: Add question
- `GET /models`: List models
- `POST /models`: Add new model
- `POST /auth/login`: Login user

## 9. Security & Compliance

- RBAC and admin-only actions
- Encrypted credentials (e.g., model API keys)
- Audit logs for all actions
- Optional offline deployment for secure environments

## 10. Deployment

- Single or multi-node via Kubernetes
- Internal-only via VPN, or public with HTTPS and MFA
- Scalable worker pools for model queries
- Secrets via environment vars or vaults
